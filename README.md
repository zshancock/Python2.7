Python Practice

##### Author - Zac Hancock (zshancock@gmail.com)

Some of my Python developments as I have progressed through coursework and online modules. 
All my codes will run if copied into Python 2.7.10. I have used Python 2.7 in combination with IDLE.
Additionally, some of my scripts are specific to using the ArcPy package.
