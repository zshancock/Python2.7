## Writing Lab Data to Attribute Tables in Shapefiles ##
### Author - Zac Hancock (zshancock@gmail.com)

This is a script I wrote to take in lab data from instruments I work with, dissect them to make a new field in a shapefile
and write the results in a new field for each clients' shapefile. All data is fake and client id's are made up to protect the 
clients I work with, but the instrument outputs are exactly as they appear when runs are completed otherwise.

The example data is in the Data Folder.

The shapefiles are not on github in this repository. 

Skills that I developed - 
[x] calling other .py files
[x] creating custom tools, "backend"
[x] comfort level in munipulating text files with python dramatically increased
[x] using update cursor and add field management in arcpy
